# Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer
My career has allowed me to apply data science and machine learning to many fields. I enjoy taking an idea from experimentation to production. I have been able to acquire strong skills in fields related to data science.
I also had the pleasure of recruiting, coaching and mentoring young data profiles.
I am now looking to put my skills at the service of a company whose impact on nature (climate, biodiversity) is positive (or neutral by default).
## *Education*
*I followed civil engineer studies, specialized in transportation system and always picked the most analytical options*
* **Imperial College London**

    *Master of Science in Transport* : Analytical pathway (2012 - 2013) 


* **Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics de l'Etat**

    *Engineering Diploma* : specialised in transportation  (2010 - 2013)


##  *Professional Experience*
*After a first job as a Civil Servant, I learnt python and  data science on my free time using Cousera and Kaggle, I then got a first Data Science job as a Junior Data Scientist at Quantmetry in 2017 and kept working in this field since until my last job leading the data team at Dataswati. I have then traveled the world with my wife for 8 months, and I am now coming back to work as a Freelance*
